## 3 levels of abstraction for Tensor operation
### 1. Schema (physical)
The real shape / physical shape of the Tensor is stored here, while also the permuted shape / external shape is stored here.
- internal access method: real shape Op
- external access method: external (permuted) shape Op
- manipulation: permute()
### 2. Tensor (logical / external)
The data pointer is stored here.
- internal access method: external shape Op
- external access method: user-level shape Op (after view)
- manipulation: inplace operators / element-wise Op, and all kinds of arithmetic Ops, view, and repeat.
- <b>caution: Only 1 view can be created at a time.</b>
- <b>after view(), no permutation is allowed.</b>
### 3. FullIterator (repeat-permitted)
